             <h3 class="section-header3">1. MARINATING CHICKEN:</h3>
             <ul class="list">
                 <li>Clean chicken, wash and cut into big pieces.</li>
                 <li>To the chicken add 1 teaspoon of red chilli powder and 1 teaspoon of salt. Rub well into the chicken and set aside.</li>
                 <li>In a large bowl, add all the ingredients under the list “For marination” and mix well.
                </li>
                <li>To start with take 2 cups yoghurt in a large bowl, add juice form 1 lemon, 1 teaspoon Red chilli powder, 
                    2 Tablespoons Ginger garlic paste and ½ teaspoon Turmeric powder.</li>

                <li>Add ½ teaspoon garam masala powder, 2 inch cinnamon sticks, 10 Cloves, 1 teaspoon cardamom powder, 1 teaspoon shahjeera or caraway seeds and 2 bay leaves.
                    Add 1 cup mint leaves (Pudina), half a cup finely chopped coriander, finely chopped,
                     8 to 10 green chillies(broken into 2 halves), required salt and mix well.</li>
                     <li>To this add the chicken pieces and rub the marinade well into the chicken.
                        Mix well and store it in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours or preferably overnight. The longer the chicken marinates,
                         the better the flavours will be infused into the chicken.</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                         <h3 class="section-header4">2. CARAMELISING ONIONS:</h3>
                         <ul class="list">
                             <li>Thinly slice 2 large onions and set aside.
                                For caramelising onions, heat a pan with 1 tablespoon oil, 
                                add sliced onions and fry till golden brown over medium heat.</li>
                                <li>Add a pinch of salt so that even with very little oil, 
                                    the onions get caramelised well.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <h3 class="section-header5">3.RICE PREPARATION:</h3>
                         <ul  class="list">
                             <li>Soaking the rice is very important because it helps the rice expand to maximum length.
                                  So soak it in the water for 30 minutes. Choose long grain basmati rice. While the rice is soaking, use the time to caramelise onions (see above step).
                                In a large pan, bring about 10 cups or surplus amount water to boil.</li>
                                <li>Add salt to the water and rice once the water starts to boil.
                                     Don’t worry about adding salt because most of the salt will go off while draining water from rice.</li>
                                     <li>Turn off the heat once the rice is half cooked. It may just take about 2 to 3 minutes. Keep an eye, as the rice should not be fully cooked.
                                        Now drain the water completely from the rice.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <h3 class="section-header6">4. LAYERING CHICKEN AND RICE:</h3>
                         <ul  class="list">
                             <li>To the half cooked rice add all the ingredients under the list “Dry masalas to add to the rice”.  Add 2 inch cinnamon sticks, 10 cloves, 1 tsp Cardamom powder, 1 tsp shah jeera & 2 bay leaves. Mix well & layer it on top of the chicken.
                                Soak saffron strands in lukewarm milk.
                                Squeeze lemon juice and set aside.</li>
                                <li>Take a wide bottomed pressure cooker and arrange the chicken in a single layer.
                                    Then add rice mixed with spices on over the meat layer.</li>
                                    <li>While you keep water for boiling to cook rice, start the process to arrange meat in the pressure pan,
                                         as the rice should be added while it is still hot.</li>
                                         <li>Now spread saffron milk and lemon juice evenly over the rice.
                                            Finally spread the fried onions over the rice.
                                            After layering the rice and meat, It is 
                                            also important to leave around 1/4th of the vessel free for the steam to collect and
                                             aid in cooking.</li>

                         </ul>
                         <h3class="section-header7">COOKING ON DUM:</h3>
                         <ul class="list">
                             <li>Close the lid of the pressure cooker (without weight) and place the cooker over high heat for 5 minutes.
                                After 5 minutes, you can see the steam escaping. At this stage place the weight and reduce the heat to medium. Let it cook for 15 minutes over medium, 
                                just ensure that the whistle shouldn’t come.</li>
                                <li>Finally reduce the heat to low and leave it for another 5 to 8 minutes. By now the aroma of the biriyani spreads in the entire house.
                                    Turn off the heat and open the lid of the cooker once the pressure subsides.</li>
                                    <li>It is good idea to open the lid after 15 minutes. Be careful when you are opening the lid  out, 
                                        because the steam can be dangerous.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <br>
                         <p>Your Chicken dum biryani is ready! There is a special cut of biryani. Put a spatula at the edge of the vessel and lift it up carefully and loosen the rice. You can see that the chicken pieces at the bottom are so well cooked and get a nice golden brown colour to them. 
                             This is the tricky part, and you will master it in no time!!</p>
